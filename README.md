The codes and data used to determine the critical temperature of a BSCCO superconductor are stored here. We used a BSCCO supercondutor and measured the resistance of it as we submerged it in LN2. Once the resistance stabilized, we removed the system from the LN2 and allowed it to slowly warm up. The data resembled a modified step-function, constant, then at a point, began linearly increasing. The transition point was taken to be the critical temperature.
